# Info

![School2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RazrabGit/MAOYSchoolMod/main/Screenshots/School2.png "School2") 

Until recently, the planet was a single whole of the planet "74 Chelyabinsk". The cause of the collapse of the planets was severe catastrophes, which led first to the cracking of the planetâ€™s crust, then to their separation. After some time, due to climate change, this planet was overtaken by a serious flood, which is why the only free, clean territory remained only the school itself. In appearance, she still looks contentedly alive, as if her hard school days and exams continue. However, over time, it really became alive, but the living creatures are clearly not people. Currently there is little danger of flooding and attacks from local fauna.
