# Coroner

A plugin which overhauls the end-of-mission Performance Report with new information, including cause of death for any deceased players. There are some fun easter eggs thrown in too.

Refactored to no longer

Built for Lethal Company v56.

**NOTE:** If you have issues when using foreign language fonts, install [FontFixer](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/EliteMasterEric/FontFixer/).

# Localization

Starting with version 1.5.0, Coroner now has support for multiple languages! Open the mod's config file (or use the Config Editor in R2Modman) to choose your desired language.

Side note, custom language files placed in the plugin folder should work, just make sure you specify your language code in the config.
