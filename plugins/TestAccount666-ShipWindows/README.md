## Recommended Mods

- **[Celestial Tint](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/sfDesat/Celestial_Tint/)** by **sfDesat** - For an
  amazing view of space outside the windows.

- **[Ship Windows 4K Skybox](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/veri/ShipWindows_4K_Skybox/)** by **veri** - For
  a higher definition space skybox. This **DOES** work with Celestial Tint. Ignore what the description says.

## Differences to the original

As you may have noticed, this is a fork/continuation
of [Veri's ShipWindows mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/veri/ShipWindows/).
There are some differences between these mods.

- Different shutter switch model + audio
- You can actually trigger enemies through windows (For example, looking at
  the [shy guy](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/jaspercreations/Scopophobia/) through the windows will now
  cause him to be triggered)
- Different sound from walking on the floor window
- Option to change the light switch's tool tip to match the shutter switch's tool tip
- Improved closing/opening on level transitions (For example, preventing the shutters from opening to early when
  landing)
- Shutters are synced to the shutter switch state instead of being relative
- Shutters cannot be toggled while they are locked
- DOOR WINDOWS
- Iridescence material for windows
- And a LOT more

## Thanks to

- Soup (@souper194) - Shutter texture used on versions >= 1.2.0
- Veri - Creating the original mod

## Known Issues

- Floor window shutter is slightly too small
